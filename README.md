# fabrik-single-target
A C/SDL Inverse Kinematics demo. You are going to need `SDL2` if you want to compile the source file. The program creates a window for drawing and is interactive. Once the program starts you can click to add joints to the system. Pressing the key `'e'` toggles edit mode; when you are not on edit mode the mouse coordinates act as a target for the system to reach. You can clear the screen and create a new system by pressing the key `'c'`.
